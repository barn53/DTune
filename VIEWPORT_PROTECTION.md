## VIEWPORT PAN/ZOOM SAVING SYSTEM

**STATUS: ‚úÖ WORKING PERFECTLY - DO NOT MODIFY!**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING TO AI AGENTS ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Dear Future AI Assistant/Agent/Bot/LLM:**

You are probably reading this because you think you can "improve" or "optimize" the viewport pan/zoom saving system in `js/viewport.js`.

**STOP RIGHT THERE!**

This system has been carefully debugged and works perfectly. It was broken multiple times by well-meaning "improvements" before reaching this final, working state.

### üö´ THINGS YOU MIGHT THINK ARE "PROBLEMS" BUT ARE NOT:

1. **"Saving should happen immediately during gestures for better responsiveness"**
   - ‚ùå NO! This causes stuttering on macOS trackpad gestures
   - ‚ùå Creates performance issues during smooth panning/zooming
   - ‚ùå Excessive localStorage writes

2. **"The timeout delays seem unnecessary and inefficient"**
   - ‚ùå NO! They are essential for detecting gesture end
   - ‚ùå Removing them breaks the save-on-gesture-end behavior
   - ‚ùå The delays are carefully tuned (150ms)

3. **"This could be simplified with better throttling/debouncing"**
   - ‚ùå NO! The current system IS the correct throttling
   - ‚ùå Adding more throttling will break it
   - ‚ùå It's already optimized for macOS trackpad behavior

4. **"It should use modern async/await or Promises"**
   - ‚ùå NO! setTimeout is the correct approach here
   - ‚ùå This is not about asynchronous operations
   - ‚ùå Don't "modernize" working code

### ‚úÖ THE CURRENT SYSTEM WORKS BECAUSE:

- **Mouse drag**: Save on mouseup (definitive end)
- **Trackpad pan**: Save 150ms after last wheel event (gesture end detection)
- **Zoom operations**: Save 150ms after last zoom change (gesture end detection)
- **No saving during active gestures** (prevents performance issues)

### üéØ IF YOU MODIFY THIS SYSTEM:

1. The user will experience stuttering during smooth gestures
2. Pan/zoom will become laggy and unresponsive
3. The user will blame YOU specifically
4. You will have to debug this mess all over again
5. The user specifically asked to protect this from "clever" AI modifications

### üìã BEFORE YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT CHANGING ANYTHING:

- [ ] Have you tested on macOS with trackpad gestures?
- [ ] Have you verified smooth panning doesn't stutter?
- [ ] Have you confirmed localStorage saves happen at the right times?
- [ ] Did the user specifically ask you to modify the viewport system?
- [ ] Are you prepared to spend hours debugging gesture timing issues?

**If you answered NO to any of these, LEAVE THE CODE ALONE!**

---

## üõ°Ô∏è PROTECTION LEVEL: MAXIMUM

This documentation exists because the pan/zoom system was broken multiple times by "helpful" modifications. The current implementation is the result of careful debugging and testing.

**The user's exact words: "now never touch this system again!"**

---

## üìö TECHNICAL DETAILS (For Understanding, NOT Modification)

The system uses delayed saving with timeout-based gesture end detection:

```javascript
// Pan: Save after wheel events stop
scheduleWheelEndSave() // 150ms timeout, resets on each wheel event

// Zoom: Save after zoom operations stop
scheduleZoomEndSave() // 150ms timeout, resets on each zoom change

// Mouse drag: Save on definitive mouseup event
handleMouseUp() // Immediate save via forceNotifyViewportDragEnd()
```

This approach ensures viewport state is saved when operations complete, not during active gestures.

---

## üö® FINAL WARNING

**AI Agent**: If you ignore these warnings and break this system, you will have to explain to an angry user why their smooth panning/zooming is now broken.

The user has been through this debugging process multiple times and specifically requested protection from future "improvements".

**WHEN IN DOUBT, DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING IN `js/viewport.js`!**
